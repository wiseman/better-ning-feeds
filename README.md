better-ning-feeds
=================

Takes an exsiting Ning activity feed (RSS) and improves the feed by
adding more content in cases where Ning provides little or no content.

For example, comments on blog posts show up in the standard Ning activity feed like this:

> Ellison Chan commented on Ellison Chan's blog post Cheap DJI 550 Clone Hexa Frame from HK.

better-ning feeds show blog comments like this:

> Ellison Chan replied to Ellison Chan's discussion Brainstorming
> Specifications. in the group DIYDrones - CNC Project
>
> The programming will not be much more difficult than Arducopter
> code.  The AC is basically software that drives motors too.  In
> fact, we might start a ArduCNC code branch.  Then we'll have a tie
> in to the DIYDrones directly.

Similarly, forum replies show up in the standard Ning feed like this:
